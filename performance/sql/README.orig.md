SQLd360 is a "free to use" tool to perform an in-depth investigation of a SQL statement. 
It collects detailed information around the SQL. It also helps to document any findings.
SQLd360 installs nothing. For better results execute connected as SYS or DBA.
It takes a few minutes to execute. Output ZIP file can be large (several MBs), so
you may want to execute SQLd360 from a system directory with at least 1 GB of free 
space. 

Steps
~~~~~
1. Unzip SQLd360.zip, navigate to the root sqld360 directory, and connect as SYS, 
   DBA, or any User with Data Dictionary access:

   $ unzip sqld360.zip
   $ cd sqld360
   $ sqlplus dba_user/dba_pwd

2. Execute sqld360.sql indicating two input parameters. The first one is to specify 
   the SQL ID for the SQL you want to analyze. The second one is to specify if your 
   database is licensed for the Oracle Tuning Pack, the Diagnostics Pack or None 
   [ T | D | N ]. Example below specifies SQL ID 0vy6pt4krb3gm, Tuning Pack. 
   Actual days of history used depends on retention period, SQLd360 uses 31 days by default. 
   Edit sql/sqld360_00_config.sql in case a shorter/longer period is desired.

   SQL> @sqld360.sql 0vy6pt4krb3gm T 
   
3. Unzip output sqld360_<dbname>_<sqlid>_<host>_YYYYMMDD_HH24MI.zip into a directory on your PC

4. Review main html file 0001_sqld360_<dbname>_index.html
